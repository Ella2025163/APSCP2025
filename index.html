		<p>  My favorite movie is Marie Antoinette. It stars Kirsten Dunst, Jason Schwartzman, Rose Byrne and Jamie Dornan. The film was written, directed, and produced by Sofia Coppola. Based on the 2001 biography Marie Antoinette: The Journey by Antonia Fraser, the film covers the life of Marie Antoinette, in the years leading to the French Revolution. I love the costumes and set design. My favorite scene is the I Want Candy montage showing the food, clothes, and shoes. </p>
